Read The Readme First
=====================

This is the API documentation for the Blessed terminal library.

Because Blessed uses quite a bit of dynamism, you should
`read the readme first`_ for a general guide and overview.

However, if you're looking for the documentation of the internal
classes, their methods, and related functions that make up the
internals, you're in the right place.
