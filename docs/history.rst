Version History
===============
1.17
  * introduced: :ref:`hyperlinks`, method :meth:`~Terminal.link`, :ghissue:`116`.
  * introduced: 24-bit color support, detected by ``term.number_of_colors == 1 << 24``, and 24-bit
    color foreground method :meth:`~Terminal.color_rgb` and background method
    :meth:`~Terminal.on_color_rgb`, as well as 676 common X11 color attribute names are now
    possible, such as ``term.aquamarine_on_wheat``, :ghissue:`60`.
  * introduced: ``term.move_xy``, recommended over built-in ``move`` capability, as the
    argument order, ``(x, y)`` matches the return value of :meth:`~.Terminal.get_location`, and all
    other common graphics library calls, :ghissue:`65`.
  * introduced: :meth:`~.Terminal.move_up`, :meth:`~Terminal.move_down`, :meth:`Terminal.move_left`,
    :meth:`~Terminal.move_right` which are strings that move the cursor one cell in the respective
    direction, are now **also** callables for moving *n* cells to the given direction, such as
    ``term.move_right(9)``.
  * introduced: :attr:`~Terminal.pixel_width` and :attr:`~Terminal.pixel_height` for libsixel
    support or general curiosity.
  * bugfix: prevent ``ValueError: I/O operation on closed file`` on ``sys.stdin`` in multiprocessing
    environments, where the keyboard wouldn't work, anyway.
  * bugfix: prevent error condition, ``ValueError: underlying buffer has been detached`` in rare
    conditions where sys.__stdout__ has been detached in test frameworks. :ghissue:`126`.
  * bugfix: off-by-one error in :meth:`~.Terminal.get_location`, now accounts for ``%i`` in
    cursor_report, :ghissue:`94`.
  * bugfix :meth:`~Terminal.split_seqs` and related functions failed to match when the color index
    was greater than 15, :ghissue:`101`.
  * bugfix: Context Managers, :meth:`~.Terminal.fullscreen`, :meth:`~.Terminal.hidden_cursor`, and
    :meth:`~Terminal.keypad` now flush the stream after writing their sequences.
  * bugfix: ``chr(127)``, ``\x7f`` has changed from keycode ``term.DELETE`` to the more common
    match, ``term.BACKSPACE``, :ghissue:115` by :ghuser:`jwezel`.
  * bugfix: ensure :class:`~.FormattingOtherString` may be pickled.
  * deprecated: the curses ``move()`` capability is no longer recommended, suggest to use
    :meth:`~.Terminal.move_xy()`, which matches the return value of :meth:`~.Terminal.get_location`.
  * deprecated: ``superscript``, ``subscript``, ``shadow``, and ``dim`` are no longer "compoundable"
    with colors, such as in phrase ``Terminal.blue_subscript('a')``.  These attributes are not
    typically supported, anyway.  Use Unicode text or 256 or 24-bit color codes instead.
  * deprecated: additional key names, such as ``KEY_TAB``, are no longer "injected" into the curses
    module namespace.
  * bugfix: briefly tried calling :func:`curses.setupterm` with :attr:`os.devnull` as the file
    descriptor, reverted. :ghissue:`59`.
  * deprecated: :meth:`~Terminal.inkey` no longer raises RuntimeError when :attr:`~Terminal.stream`
    is not a terminal, programs using :meth:`~Terminal.inkey` to block indefinitely if a keyboard is
    not attached. :ghissue:`69`.
  * deprecated: using argument ``_intr_continue`` to method :meth:`~Terminal.kbhit`, behavior is as
    though such value is always True since 1.9.

1.16
  * introduced: Windows support?! :ghpull:`110` by :ghuser:`avylove`.

1.15
  * enhancement: disable timing integration tests for keyboard routines.
  * enhancement: Support python 3.7. :ghpull:`102`.
  * enhancement: Various fixes to test automation :ghpull:`108`

1.14
  * bugfix: :meth:`~.Terminal.wrap` misbehaved for text containing newlines,
    :ghissue:`74`.
  * bugfix: TypeError when using ``PYTHONOPTIMIZE=2`` environment variable,
    :ghissue:`84`.
  * bugfix: define ``blessed.__version__`` value,
    :ghissue:`92`.
  * bugfix: detect sequences ``\x1b[0K`` and ``\x1b2K``,
    :ghissue:`95`.

1.13
  * enhancement: :meth:`~.Terminal.split_seqs` introduced, and 4x cost
    reduction in related sequence-aware functions, :ghissue:`29`.
  * deprecated: ``blessed.sequences.measure_length`` function superseded by
    :func:`~.iter_parse` if necessary.
  * deprecated: warnings about "binary-packed capabilities" are no longer
    emitted on strange terminal types, making best effort.

1.12
  * enhancement: :meth:`~.Terminal.get_location` returns the ``(row, col)``
    position of the cursor at the time of call for attached terminal.
  * enhancement: a keyboard now detected as *stdin* when
    :paramref:`~.Terminal.__init__.stream` is :obj:`sys.stderr`.

1.11
  * enhancement: :meth:`~.Terminal.inkey` can return more quickly for
    combinations such as ``Alt + Z`` when ``MetaSendsEscape`` is enabled,
    :ghissue:`30`.
  * enhancement: :class:`~.FormattingString` may now be nested, such as
    ``t.red('red', t.underline('rum'))``, :ghissue:`61`

1.10
  * workaround: provide ``sc`` and ``rc`` for Terminals of ``kind='ansi'``,
    repairing :meth:`~.Terminal.location` :ghissue:`44`.
  * bugfix: length of simple SGR reset sequence ``\x1b[m`` was not correctly
    determined on all terminal types, :ghissue:`45`.
  * deprecated: ``_intr_continue`` arguments introduced in 1.8 are now marked
    deprecated in 1.10: beginning with python 3.5, the default behavior is as
    though this argument is always True, `PEP-475
    <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0475/>`_, blessed does the same.

1.9
  * enhancement: :paramref:`~.Terminal.wrap.break_long_words` now supported by
    :meth:`Terminal.wrap`
  * Ignore :class:`curses.error` message ``'tparm() returned NULL'``:
    this occurs on win32 or other platforms using a limited curses
    implementation, such as PDCurses_, where :func:`curses.tparm` is
    not implemented, or no terminal capability database is available.
  * Context manager :meth:`~.keypad` emits sequences that enable
    "application keys" such as the diagonal keys on the numpad.
    This is equivalent to :meth:`curses.window.keypad`.
  * bugfix: translate keypad application keys correctly.
  * enhancement: no longer depend on the '2to3' tool for python 3 support.
  * enhancement: allow ``civis`` and ``cnorm`` (*hide_cursor*, *normal_hide*)
    to work with terminal-type *ansi* by emulating support by proxy.
  * enhancement: new public attribute: :attr:`~.kind`: the very same as given
    :paramref:`Terminal.__init__.kind` keyword argument.  Or, when not given,
    determined by and equivalent to the ``TERM`` Environment variable.

1.8
  * enhancement: export keyboard-read function as public method ``getch()``,
    so that it may be overridden by custom terminal implementers.
  * enhancement: allow :meth:`~.inkey` and :meth:`~.kbhit` to return early
    when interrupted by signal by passing argument ``_intr_continue=False``.
  * enhancement: allow ``hpa`` and ``vpa`` (*move_x*, *move_y*) to work on
    tmux(1) or screen(1) by emulating support by proxy.
  * enhancement: add :meth:`~.Terminal.rstrip` and :meth:`~.Terminal.lstrip`,
    strips both sequences and trailing or leading whitespace, respectively.
  * enhancement: include wcwidth_ library support for
    :meth:`~.Terminal.length`: the printable width of many kinds of CJK
    (Chinese, Japanese, Korean) ideographs and various combining characters
    may now be determined.
  * enhancement: better support for detecting the length or sequences of
    externally-generated *ecma-48* codes when using ``xterm`` or ``aixterm``.
  * bugfix: when :func:`locale.getpreferredencoding` returns empty string or
    an encoding that is not valid for ``codecs.getincrementaldecoder``,
    fallback to ASCII and emit a warning.
  * bugfix: ensure :class:`~.FormattingString` and
    :class:`~.ParameterizingString` may be pickled.
  * bugfix: allow `~.inkey` and related to be called without a keyboard.
  * **change**: ``term.keyboard_fd`` is set ``None`` if ``stream`` or
    ``sys.stdout`` is not a tty, making ``term.inkey()``, ``term.cbreak()``,
    ``term.raw()``, no-op.
  * bugfix: ``\x1bOH`` (KEY_HOME) was incorrectly mapped as KEY_LEFT.

1.7
  * Forked github project `erikrose/blessings`_ to `jquast/blessed`_, this
    project was previously known as **blessings** version 1.6 and prior.
  * introduced: context manager :meth:`~.cbreak`, which is equivalent to
    entering terminal state by :func:`tty.setcbreak` and returning
    on exit, as well as the lesser recommended :meth:`~.raw`,
    pairing from :func:`tty.setraw`.
  * introduced: :meth:`~.inkey`, which will return one or more characters
    received by the keyboard as a unicode sequence, with additional attributes
    :attr:`~.Keystroke.code` and :attr:`~.Keystroke.name`.  This allows
    application keys (such as the up arrow, or home key) to be detected.
    Optional value :paramref:`~.inkey.timeout` allows for timed poll.
  * introduced: :meth:`~.Terminal.center`, :meth:`~.Terminal.rjust`,
    :meth:`~.Terminal.ljust`, allowing text containing sequences to be aligned
    to detected horizontal screen width, or by
    :paramref:`~.Terminal.center.width` specified.
  * introduced: :meth:`~.wrap` method.  Allows text containing sequences to be
    word-wrapped without breaking mid-sequence, honoring their printable width.
  * introduced: :meth:`~.Terminal.strip`, strips all sequences *and*
    whitespace.
  * introduced: :meth:`~.Terminal.strip_seqs` strip only sequences.
  * introduced: :meth:`~.Terminal.rstrip` and :meth:`~.Terminal.lstrip` strips
    both sequences and trailing or leading whitespace, respectively.
  * bugfix: cannot call :func:`curses.setupterm` more than once per process
    (from :meth:`Terminal.__init__`):  Previously, blessed pretended
    to support several instances of different Terminal :attr:`~.kind`, but was
    actually using the :attr:`~.kind` specified by the first instantiation of
    :class:`~.Terminal`.  A warning is now issued.  Although this is
    misbehavior is still allowed, a :class:`warnings.WarningMessage` is now
    emitted to notify about subsequent terminal misbehavior.
  * bugfix: resolved issue where :attr:`~.number_of_colors` fails when
    :attr:`~.does_styling` is ``False``.  Resolves issue where piping tests
    output would fail.
  * bugfix: warn and set :attr:`~.does_styling` to ``False`` when the given
    :attr:`~.kind` is not found in the terminal capability database.
  * bugfix: allow unsupported terminal capabilities to be callable just as
    supported capabilities, so that the return value of
    :attr:`~.color`\(n) may be called on terminals without color
    capabilities.
  * bugfix: for terminals without underline, such as vt220,
    ``term.underline('text')`` would emit ``'text' + term.normal``.
    Now it emits only ``'text'``.
  * enhancement: some attributes are now properties, raise exceptions when
    assigned.
  * enhancement: pypy is now a supported python platform implementation.
  * enhancement: removed pokemon ``curses.error`` exceptions.
  * enhancement: do not ignore :class:`curses.error` exceptions, unhandled
    curses errors are legitimate errors and should be reported as a bug.
  * enhancement: converted nose tests to pytest, merged travis and tox.
  * enhancement: pytest fixtures, paired with a new ``@as_subprocess``
    decorator
    are used to test a multitude of terminal types.
  * enhancement: test accessories ``@as_subprocess`` resolves various issues
    with different terminal types that previously went untested.
  * deprecation: python2.5 is no longer supported (as tox does not supported).

1.6
  * Add :attr:`~.does_styling`. This takes :attr:`~.force_styling`
    into account and should replace most uses of :attr:`~.is_a_tty`.
  * Make :attr:`~.is_a_tty` a read-only property like :attr:`~.does_styling`.
    Writing to it never would have done anything constructive.
  * Add :meth:`~.fullscreen`` and :meth:`hidden_cursor` to the
    auto-generated docs.

1.5.1
  * Clean up fabfile, removing the redundant ``test`` command.
  * Add Travis support.
  * Make ``python setup.py test`` work without spurious errors on 2.6.
  * Work around a tox parsing bug in its config file.
  * Make context managers clean up after themselves even if there's an
    exception (`Vitja Makarov #29 <https://github.com/erikrose/blessings/pull/29>`).
  * Parameterizing a capability no longer crashes when there is no tty
    (`<Vitja Makarov #31 <https://github.com/erikrose/blessings/pull/31>`)

1.5
  * Add syntactic sugar and documentation for ``enter_fullscreen``
    and ``exit_fullscreen``.
  * Add context managers :meth:`~.fullscreen` and :meth:`~.hidden_cursor`.
  * Now you can force a :class:`~.Terminal` to never to emit styles by
    passing keyword argument ``force_styling=None``.

1.4
  * Add syntactic sugar for cursor visibility control and single-space-movement
    capabilities.
  * Endorse the :meth:`~.location` context manager for restoring cursor
    position after a series of manual movements.
  * Fix a bug in which :meth:`~.location` that wouldn't do anything when
    passed zeros.
  * Allow tests to be run with ``python setup.py test``.

1.3
  * Added :attr:`~.number_of_colors`, which tells you how many colors the
    terminal supports.
  * Made :attr:`~.color`\(n) and :attr:`~.on_color`\(n) callable to wrap a
    string, like the named colors can. Also, make them both fall back to the
    ``setf`` and ``setb`` capabilities (like the named colors do) if the
    termcap entries for ``setaf`` and ``setab`` are not available.
  * Allowed :attr:`~.color` to act as an unparametrized string, not just a
    callable.
  * Made :attr:`~.height` and :attr:`~.width` examine any passed-in stream
    before falling back to stdout (This rarely if ever affects actual behavior;
    it's mostly philosophical).
  * Made caching simpler and slightly more efficient.
  * Got rid of a reference cycle between :class:`~.Terminal` and
    :class:`~.FormattingString`.
  * Updated docs to reflect that terminal addressing (as in :meth:`~location`)
    is 0-based.

1.2
  * Added support for Python 3! We need 3.2.3 or greater, because the curses
    library couldn't decide whether to accept strs or bytes before that
    (https://bugs.python.org/issue10570).
  * Everything that comes out of the library is now unicode. This lets us
    support Python 3 without making a mess of the code, and Python 2 should
    continue to work unless you were testing types (and badly). Please file a
    bug if this causes trouble for you.
  * Changed to the MIT License for better world domination.
  * Added Sphinx docs.

1.1
  * Added nicely named attributes for colors.
  * Introduced compound formatting.
  * Added wrapper behavior for styling and colors.
  * Let you force capabilities to be non-empty, even if the output stream is
    not a terminal.
  * Added :attr:`~.is_a_tty` to determine whether the output stream is a
    terminal.
  * Sugared the remaining interesting string capabilities.
  * Allow :meth:`~.location` to operate on just an x *or* y coordinate.

1.0
