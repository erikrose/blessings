            Environment variable.

            .. note:: A terminal of only one ``kind`` may be initialized for

            If ``stream`` is not a tty, empty Unicode strings are returned for
            all capability values, so things like piping your program output to
            a pipe or file does not emit terminal sequences.

            happen, use ``force_styling=None``.

            of terminal sequences.
