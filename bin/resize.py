"""
Determines and prints COLUMNS and LINES of the attached window width.

A strange problem: programs that perform screen addressing incorrectly
determine the screen margins.  Calls to reset(1) do not resolve the
issue.

This may often happen because the transport is incapable of communicating
the terminal size, such as over a serial line.  This demonstration program
determines true screen dimensions and produces output suitable for evaluation
by a bourne-like shell::

        $ eval `./resize.py`

The following remote login protocols communicate window size:

 - ssh: notifies on dedicated session channel, see for example,
   ``paramiko.ServerInterface.check_channel_window_change_request``.

 - telnet: sends window size through NAWS (negotiate about window
   size, RFC 1073), see for example,
   ``telnetlib3.TelnetServer.naws_receive``.

 - rlogin: protocol sends only initial window size, and does not notify
   about size changes.

This is a simplified version of `resize.c
<https://github.com/joejulian/xterm/blob/master/resize.c>`_ provided by the
xterm package.
