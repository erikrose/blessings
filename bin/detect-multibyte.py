"""
Determines whether the attached terminal supports multibyte encodings.

Problem: A screen drawing application wants to detect whether the terminal
client is capable of rendering utf-8.  Some transports, such as a serial link,
often cannot forward their ``LANG`` environment preference, or protocols such
as telnet and rlogin often assume mutual agreement by manual configuration.

We can interactively determine whether the connecting terminal emulator is
rendering in utf8 by making an inquiry of their cursor position:

    - request cursor position (p0).

    - display multibyte character.

    - request cursor position (p1).

If the horizontal distance of (p0, p1) is 1 cell, we know the connecting
client is certainly matching our intended encoding.

As a (tough!) exercise, it may be possible to use this technique to accurately
determine the remote encoding without protocol negotiation using cursor
positioning alone through a complex state decision tree, as demonstrated
by the following diagram:
