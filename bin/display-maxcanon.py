"""
This tool uses pexpect to test expected Canonical mode length.

All systems use the value of MAX_CANON which can be found using
fpathconf(3) value PC_MAX_CANON -- with the exception of Linux
and FreeBSD.

Linux, though defining a value of 255, actually honors the value
of 4096 from linux kernel include file tty.h definition
N_TTY_BUF_SIZE.

Linux also does not honor IMAXBEL. termios(3) states, "Linux does not
implement this bit, and acts as if it is always set." Although these
tests ensure it is enabled, this is a non-op for Linux.

FreeBSD supports neither, and instead uses a fraction (1/5) of the tty
speed which is always 9600.  Therefor, the maximum limited input line
length is 9600 / 5 = 1920.

In other words, the only way to determine the true MAX_CANON in a
cross-platform manner is through this systems integrated test: the given
system definitions are misleading on some operating systems.
