This is an example application for the 'blessed' Terminal library for python.

Window size changes are caught by the 'on_resize' function using a traditional
signal handler.  Meanwhile, blocking keyboard input is displayed to stdout.
If a resize event is discovered, an empty string is returned by term.inkey()
when _intr_continue is False, as it is here.
